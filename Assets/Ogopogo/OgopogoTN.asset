    Scientific name: Macrobdella-rostrata



    Thought to have
    gone extinct more than six hundred years ago, these cave-dwelling macro-leeches
    have somewhat recently surfaced back up around the Thistle Nebula. Not much is
    known about their biology, but they seem to lack eyesight and hearing, along
    with always having multiple smaller Macrobdella-rostrata swimming around them.
    Two of them have never been spotted in proximity to each other before or after
    their reappearance.



    The first reported sighting of Macrobdella-rostrata
    was in 1926 when a mining company accidentally hit a water deposit deep below
    the ground, where a lone specimen was living out its last days. Subsequent sightings
    seemed to confirm they only inhabited underground water deposits, but in 2830
    a clew of their young was spotted feeding on an unidentified creature''s carcass
    at the bottom of a lake.

    Old stories from mining expeditions speak of their
    long, tendril-like snouts which they used to feel around for prey inside caves;
    even so, they seemed unbothered by the presence of humans and appeared passive
    around most creatures.



    They have been recently discovered to be quite
    territorial and extremely protective of their young, so it is advised to stay
    away from their nests and to never sit still for too long.



    No dead specimens
    have ever been found.'
